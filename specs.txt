Time boxing for
students with schedules
built around Canvas
assignments
● Our application connects to the Canvas API to pull
assignment and exam dates directly, generating a
personalized daily schedule that ensures students stay
on top of deadlines and feel confident for exams.
● Students can add their own events so the schedule
reflects both academic and personal commitments.
● By answering a few quick questions about their
workflow and study habits, each student receives a
practical, AI-driven schedule tailored to their unique
needs.

THIS IS A MOBLIE APP FOR BOTH IOS AND ANDRIOD

Deliverables: Update presentation in PA2, add in video demo of working code, link to code to run in class.
	1	Refined Architecture + Final Wireframes
	◦	Updated diagrams and screens reflecting feedback or pivot decisions
	2	Functional Code Prototype
	◦	Must include:
	▪	Two-factor login (can be dummy 2FA if needed)
	▪	Integrated AI tool (e.g., GPT for generation, CodeWhisperer for suggestion)
	▪	Use of GitHub Copilot, Amazon CodeWhisperer, or Tabnine in development (cite examples)
	▪	Key user stories from Part 2 implemented
	3	Ethical Reflection (1–2 slides as a group)
	◦	What ethical challenges did you face in implementation?
	◦	How did you ensure responsible AI use and system reliability?
	◦	What would you improve before real deployment?

User Stories
● As a user, I want to limit what courses or sections of canvas can be accessed by the application so that I
can keep my privacy while using the application.
● As a user, I want to choose what the application specifically considers when making a scheduled so that
my schedule can align with my personal habits.
● As a user, I want to be able to modify a generated schedule so that I can have some input in the event
that the schedule is not as efficient as possible.
● As a user, I want to have the ability to disable notifications so that I can choose not receive messages
from the application if I find them to be bothersome.
Emmanuel SMU Fall 2025 User Stories
● As a user, I want the AI to analyze my workload and suggest optimal time blocks for studying so that I
can focus on learning rather than manually planning.
● As a user, I want to integrate my personal calendar (e.g., Google Calendar, Apple Calendar) so that the
generated schedule automatically accounts for my existing events and commitments.
● As a user, I want to receive smart reminders that adapt based on my progress, so that the app
encourages me without overwhelming me.
● As a user, I want to set specific focus hours and break periods so that the schedule reflects how I
actually work best throughout the day.
